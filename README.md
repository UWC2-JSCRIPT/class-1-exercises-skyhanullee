Questions (started in class):
Math / Numbers:

1. Pagliacci charges $16.99 for a 13” pizza and $19.99 for a 17” pizza.  What is the surface area for each of these pizzas?

2. What is the cost per square inch of each pizza?

3. Using the Math object, put together a code snippet that allows you to draw a random card with a value between 1 and 13 (assume ace is 1, jack is 11…)

4. Draw 3 cards and use Math to determine the highest card

Strings / Addresses

1. Create variables for firstName, lastName, streetAddress, city, state, and zipCode. Use this information to create a formatted address block that could be printed onto an envelope.

2. You are given a string in this format:

firstName lastName
streetAddress
city, state zip
Write code that is able to extract the first name from this string into a variable.  Hint: use indexOf, slice, and / or substring

Date

On your own find the middle date(and time) between the following two dates:
1/1/2020 00:00:00 and 4/1/2020 00:00:00

Starting hint:

const startDate = new Date(2020, 0, 1);
